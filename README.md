## How to install?
* To install, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/cooolgamer/3DS-custom-keyboard/releases) then download the "Coool Custom Keyboard (your region).cia" file and install it with FBI!
* Enjoy!

## How to uninstall? (Do it if really needed)
* Go to FBI, titles, then search for a red title corresponding to your region (000400300000D002 for EUR, 000400300000C802 for USA),
* Select it and chose delete title and ticket then confirm,
* The keyboard is now gone, now we are going to get the original back,
* Because system settings cannot be launched at this state, we are going to use the safemode,
* Power off the console then hold UP+A+L+R then press power and still hold the buttons (except power) until you see a menu,
* On this menu, press next, and accept everything then wait for the update to finish,
* If the update is correctly finished, press OK and the original keyboard is now back,
* If you get a error, try again with a mobile wifi hotspot,
* If you can't/still don't work, join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/V9FShC5q8h) and I will help you (I tested it myself and it worked so it should work for you).

## Warning: the keyboard isn't signed, meaning you SHOULD NOT uninstall your custom firmware. If you want to, follow the uninstallation tutorial.
I am not responsible if you did, and have issues related to keyboard, you have been warned.
